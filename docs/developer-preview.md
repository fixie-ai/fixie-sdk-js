## Welcome to the Fixie Developer Preview

Welcome to Fixie! We're happy you're here. We wanted to give you a brief overview of how things work and where to get help if you need stuck.

We strongly recommend [joining the community on Discord](https://discord.gg/MsKAeKF8kU). The entire Fixie team is on hand ready to answer questions and help you if you get stuck.

For the Developer Preview Period, there is no charge to use Fixie, but you are limited to 1,000 Fixie queries per day. If you need more, or are interested in use-cases for business, please reach out at hello@fixie.ai and we can help.

If you're just getting started, you'll probably want to check out our [agent examples repo](https://github.com/fixie-ai/fixie-examples) along with exploring the rest of the docs on this site.

Lastly, just a reminder that Fixie is evolving rapidly, so expect a few bugs here and there. Please let us know when you run into these, and we'll do our best to fix them ASAP. Also, is there something you can't do but you'd like to? Let us know! We love feature requests.
