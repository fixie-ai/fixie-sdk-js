# Developing a Fixie Agent

The Fixie platform allows you to build Agents in any language of your choice, by writing
a service that conforms to the protocol described in [Agent Protocol](agent-protocol.md).
For Python developers, we provide a Python library that makes it easy to implement Agents
using the API described below.

For a quick start on building your own Fixie Agent, check out the [Quick Start](agent-quickstart.md) guide.

See [Fixie Agent Python API](python-agent-api.md) for the full API reference.

## CodeShotAgent

The base class for Agents in Fixie is [`CodeShotAgent`][fixieai.agents.code_shot. codeshotagent].
This class takes care of communicating with the Fixie platform via the [Agent Protocol](agent-protocol.md),
and provides a simple API for registering functions that can be invoked by the few-shot examples
used by the Agent.

The structure of a `CodeShotAgent` is typically as follows:

```python
import fixieai

BASE_PROMPT = "Base prompt for the agent."
FEW_SHOTS = """
Q: Example query for the Agent
Ask Func[my_func]: query to the func
Func[my_func] says: response to the query
A: Response generated by the Agent

Q: Second example query to the agent
A: Second response generated by the Agent
"""

agent = fixieai.CodeShotAgent(BASE_PROMPT, FEW_SHOTS)

@agent.register_func()
def my_func(query: fixieai.Message) -> str:
    return "Response to the query"
```

The `BASE_PROMPT` and `FEW_SHOTS` strings are used to provide examples to the underlying
Large Language Model, such as GPT-3, as well as to provide the Fixie Platform information
on what kinds of queries this Agent can support.

The `FEW_SHOTS` provided to an Agent must be a string consisting of one or more _stanzas_, where
each stanza consists of a question, one or more rounds of internal actions taken by the Agent,
and a final answer. Stanzas must be separated from each other by a blank line. The query line
in the stanza must start with `Q:`, and the answer line must start with `A:`.

Internal actions taken by the Agent can be of one of two forms:

- `Ask Func[<func_name>]: <query_text>`: This indicates that the function `<func_name>` should
  be invoked when the output of the underlying LLM starts with this string. The string following
  `Ask Func[<func_name>]:` is passed to the function as the `query.text` parameter.
- `Ask Agent[<agent_name>]: <query_text>`: This indicates that the Agent `<agent_name>` should
  be invoked when the output of the underlying LLM starts with this string. The string following
  `Ask Agent[<agent_name>]:` is passed to the Agent as the `query.text` parameter.

## Agent Funcs

A **Func** is a function, defined in Python, that can be invoked by the Agent.
(Note that Funcs need not be implemented in Python; you can implement Agents in other
languages, as long as they adhere to the Fixie [Agent Protocol](agent-protocol.md).)
As described above, when the language model for an Agent emits the token `Ask Func[<func_name>]`,
the function `<func_name>` will be invoked.

The `register_func` decorator is used to register a function that can be invoked by the Agent.

A function registered with the `register_func` decorator has the signature:

```python
@agent.register_func()
def my_func(query, user_storage=None, oauth_handler=None):
    ...
```

The `query` parameter is either a `str` a [`Message`][fixieai.agents.api.message] object.
If the query parameter is a string, this parameter contains the text of the Agent query.
If the query parameter is a `Message` object, this parameter contains the text of the Agent
along with zero or more [`Embed`][fixieai.agents.api.embed] objects, as described in the
[Embeds](#embeds) section below.

The optional `user_storage` parameter provides the Func an interface to the Fixie
[User Storage](#user-storage) service, as described below.

The optional `oauth_handler` parameter provides the Func an interface to performing
OAuth authentication with external services, as described in the [OAuth](#agent-oauth-support) section
below.

The function must return either a `str` or a [`Message`][fixieai.agents.api.message] object.
Returning a string is equivalent to returning a `Message` object with the string as its `text`
field, and no `embeds`.

## Embeds

**Embeds** allow arbitrary binary data to be associated with a query or response Message in
Fixie, similar to email attachments. Embeds can be used to store images, video, text, or
any other binary data.

Embeds are represented by the [`Embed`][fixieai.agents.api.embed] class. Agents can access
the Embeds associated with a Message as follows:

```python
@agent.register_func()
def my_func(query: fixieai.Message) -> str:
    for key, embed in query.embeds.items():
        print(f"Embed key: {key}")
        print(f"Embed content-type: {embed.content_type}")
        embed_value_as_text = embed.text
        embed_value_as_bytes = embed.content
```

An Agent function can also add an Embed to its response Message by adding it to the
`embeds` dictionary of the `Message` object:

```python
@agent.register_func()
def my_func(query: fixieai.Message) -> fixieai.Message:
  reply = fixieai.Message("Response to the query")
  reply.embeds["my_embed"] = fixieai.Embed(content_type="text/plain")
  reply.embeds["my_embed"].text = "Hello, world!"
```

Embeds can be queried by leveraging the built-in `fixie_query_embed` func. e.g., `Ask Func[fixie_query_embed]`. See [example](https://github.com/fixie-ai/fixie-examples/tree/main/agents/chatembed) of how this works.

## External Knowledge Base Support

Fixie Agents come with built-in support for indexing and querying external knowledge in the form of URLs. See the [support agent](https://github.com/fixie-ai/fixie-examples/tree/main/agents/support) for an example of how to use this.

```python
URLS = [
    "https://docs.fixie.ai/*",
]
DOCS = [fixieai.DocumentCorpus(urls=URLS)]
agent = fixieai.CodeShotAgent(BASE_PROMPT, FEW_SHOTS, DOCS)
```

Appending `*` to the end of the URL will tell Fixie to automatically index all children of the root URL.

After indexing, you can query the corpus using the build in `Ask Func[fixie_query_corpus]` function.

Note: It can take up to 10 minutes to index content, depending on the number of URLs and content size. We're working on a mechanism to alert you to indexing progress. Stay tuned!

## User Storage

Fixie Agents can store and retrieve arbitrary data associated with a user, using the
[`UserStorage`][fixieai.agents.userstorage] class. This class provides a simple
interface to a persistent key/value storage service, with a separate key/value
store for each Fixie user. This can be used to maintain state about a particular
user that persists across Agent invocations.

The `UserStorage` instance for a given query can be obtained by providing a `user_storage`

parameter to an Agent function. The `UserStorage` object acts as a Python `dict` that stores
state associated with an arbitrary string key. `UserStorage` values may consist of Python
primitive types, such as `str`, `int`, `float`, `bool`, `None`, or `bytes`, as well as
lists of these types, or a Dict mapping a `str` to one of these types.

### User Storage Example

```python
@agent.register_func()
def my_func(query: fixieai.Message, user_storage: fixieai.UserStorage) -> str:
    user_storage["my_key"] = "my_value"
    return user_storage["my_key"]
```

## Agent OAuth Support

Fixie Agents can authenticate to third-party services to perform
actions on behalf of the user. This is done using OAuth 2.0, which
is a standard protocol for authorization. OAuth 2.0 allows users
to grant limited access to their accounts on one service, to another
service, without having to share their password.

Fixie provides a simple interface for Agents to perform OAuth
authentication, using the [`OAuthParams`][fixieai.agents.oauthparams] class.
Using this class, an Agent function can use the [`OAuthHandler`][fixieai.agents.oauthhandler]
class -- which is passed to the function as the `oauth_handler` parameter -- to obtain an access
token for the user.

### OAuth Example

```python
import fixieai

oauth_params = fixieai.OAuthParams()
oauth_params.client_id = "XXXXX.apps.googleusercontent.com",
oauth_params.auth_uri = "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth"
oauth_params.token_uri = "https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token"
oauth_params.client_secret = "XXXXXXXXX"

agent = fixieai.CodeShotAgent(BASE_PROMPT, FEW_SHOTS, oauth_params=oauth_params)

@agent.register_func
def my_func(query, oauth_handler: fixieai.OAuthHandler):
  user_token = oauth_handler.user_token()
  if user_token is None:
    # Return the URL that the user should click on to authorize the Agent.
    return oauth_handler.get_authorization_url()

  # Do something with the user_token returned by the OAuth handler.
  client = gcalendar_client.GcalendarClient(user_token)
  # ...
```

## Agent Default Model and Model Params

By default, agents use the `text-davinci-003` model from OpenAI with a default temperature of `0` and a `maximum_tokens` size of 1,000. We've found this to be the right default for many use cases, but it's easy to change by passing in `llm_settings` when initializing your `CodeShotAgent`.

Here's an example:

```python
agent = fixieai.CodeShotAgent(
    BASE_PROMPT,
    [],
    conversational=True,
    llm_settings=fixieai.LlmSettings(temperature=1.0, model="gpt-4", maximum_tokens=500),
)
```

Here are the following models that we support:

| Model Name          | Identifier String                   |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| GPT-3               | `openai/text-davinci-003` (default) |
| GPT-3.5 (ChatGPT)   | `openai/gpt-3.5-turbo`              |
| GPT-4               | `openai/gpt-4`                      |
| AI21 J2 Grande      | `ai21/j2-grande`                    |
| AI21 J2 Jumbo       | `ai21/j2-jumbo`                     |
| GooseAI GPTJ 6B     | `gooseai/gpt-j-6b`                  |
| GooseAI GPT NEO 20B | `gooseai/gpt-neo-20b`               |

## Built-in functions

All Fixie agents have access to the following set of built-in functions that they can invoke.

- `Ask Func[fixie_base_prompt]`: Returns the base prompt for the agent.
- `Ask Func[fixie_local_datetime]`: Returns the current datetime in the user's local timezone.
- `Ask Func[fixie_utc_datetime]`: Returns the current datetime in UTC timezone.
- `Ask Func[fixie_query_embed]`: Runs the prompt in the query against the contents of the embed.
- `Ask Func[fixie_query_corpus]`: Runs the prompt in the query against the contents of the agent-defined corpus.
