class CorpusRequest(dataclasses_json.DataClassJsonMixin):
    """A request for some piece of the agent's corpus.

    In addition to returning documents, each response may expand the corpus
    space in one or both of two dimensions:
        Responses may include new partitions to be loaded. Partitions are
            non-overlapping subsets of a corpus which may be loaded in parallel
            by Fixie. A response's new partitions will be ignored if previously
            included in another response.
        When a response includes a page of documents, that page may indicate
            that another page is available in the same partition. Pages are
            always loaded serially in order. The partition is completed when
            a response has a page with no next_page_token.

    Agents will always receive a first request with the default (unnamed)
    partition and no page_token. Subsequent requests depend on prior responses
    and will always include at least one of those fields.

    Examples:
        Simple handful of documents:
            When receiving the initial request, the agent responds with a page
            of documents. This could include a next_page_token for more
            documents in the single default partition if needed.
        Web crawl:
            Each URL corresponds to a partition and the agent never returns
            tokens. The initial response only includes partitions, one for each
            root URL to crawl. Each subsequent request includes the partition
            (the URL) and the corresponding response contains a page with a
            single document - the resource at that URL. If the document links
            to other resources that should be included in the corpus, the
            response also contains those URLs as new partitions. The process
            repeats for all partitions until there are no known incomplete
            partitions or until crawl limits are reached.
        Database:
            Consider a database with a parent table keyed by parent_id and an
            interleaved child table keyed by (parent_id, child_id) whose rows
            correspond to corpus documents. This agent will use tokens that
            encode a read timestamp (for consistency) and an offset to be used
            in combination with a static page size.

            Upon receiving the initial CorpusRequest, the agent chooses a
            commit timestamp to use for all reads and returns a partition for
            each parent_id along with a first_page_token indicating the chosen
            read timestamp and an offset of 0.

            For each partition, the agent then receives requests with the
            partition (a parent_id) and a page token (the read timestamp and
            offest). It responds with documents corresponding to the next page
            size child rows within the given parent. If more children exist,
            the response includes a next_page_token with the same read
            timestamp and an incremented offset. This repeats until there are
            no more children, at which point the response has no
            next_page_token and the partition is complete.

            Note: Including multiple parent_ids in each partition would also
                work and would be an effective way to limit parallelism if
                desired.

    Args:
        partition: The partition of the corpus that should be read. This will
            be empty for the initial request, indicating the default partition.
            For subsequent requests, it will either be the name of a partition
            returned by a previous request or empty if the default partition
            contains multiple pages for this agent.
        page_token: A token for paginating results within a corpus partition.
            If present, this will be echoed from a previous response.
