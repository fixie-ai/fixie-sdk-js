# fixie-common

This is a TypeScript package providing an SDK for the Fixie AI platform,
shared between both NodeJS and browser environments.

This package is not meant to be imported directly. Instead, use
the `fixie` package for NodeJS environments, and `fixie-web` for
browser environments.

For more information, see the Fixie developer portal at
[https://fixie.ai/docs](https://fixie.ai/docs).
